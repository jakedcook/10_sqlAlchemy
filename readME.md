## Surfs Up!

With a vacation long over due, we have decided to plan a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii! To help with our trip planning, we've created a Python script with Pandas, Matplotlib and SQLAlchemy to find the ideal weather conditions.

In our Python script we want to retrieve information like, the last 12 months of precipitaion data:

and the last 12 months of temperature observations:
